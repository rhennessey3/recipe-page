                        It’s nice when I wake up and there’s a jar of cold
                        brew in the fridge, ready to be diluted by glugs and
                        glugs of milk—just the way I like it. But more often
                        than not, someone (okay, it’s me) forgets to make it.
                        (And then there’s the issue of fitting yet another
                        jar into the already-packed fridge…) So instead of
                        making cold brew, I’ve been turning to Japanese-style
                        iced coffee a.k.a. flash-brewed coffee a.k.a. ice
                        brew a.k.a. brewing super strong coffee directly
                        over ice. The hot drip melts the ice, diluting the
                        coffee to the perfect strength while also cooling
                        it down immediately. It’s ready in about 10 minutes
                        (including bringing the water to a boil), and—not
                        to offend all the cold brew fanatics out
                        there—but… I actually like the taste better?
